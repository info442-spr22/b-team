 ## Problem 

The switch to online learning during the pandemic has created a greater educational divide between low-income students and their peers. Students from low-income families have lower grades and higher absenteeism rates when attending classes online, due to a lack of access to technology and a suitable learning environment. As schools transition back to in-person learning, they are continuing to utilize the same technologies they had used during the pandemic to teach and engage students. This will cause low-income students to remain excluded and discouraged from pursuing their education. How might we aid low-income students in acquiring the necessary digital resources for a high-quality education so that they do not fall further behind?

According to New America, internet access at home is required for students to receive a quality education. However, approximately 16.9 million children do not have access to high-speed internet at home (Farry, 2021). A vast majority of the children in this statistic are low-income people of color, with African American and Hispanic households being 1.3 to 1.4 times as likely as white households to lack digital accessibility (McDonald, 2020). This problem persists in early education in marginalized communities and it is critical to aid these students before they fall through the cracks of education. The UN states that as classrooms shift to relying on technology for learning and homework, low-income students are less equipped to participate and are at a high risk of dropping out of school (Guterres,  2021). In this pursuit, it is essential for us to involve support for and from the educators. 

Washington State, specifically, has seen increased inequities in quality education through the pandemic. In 2019, the Washington Education Association began the process of creating educational justice work called “A Roadmap to Reducing Barriers to Educational Justice in Washington State” that states various barriers to the educational justice that our state’s system of education presents for underrepresented and marginalized students (Skipton, 2021). This was only exemplified when COVID-19 hit. Causes such as lack of funds, conditions, and large student-to-teacher ratios have all contributed to inadequate education for low-income students. With many existing solutions not being able to fulfill the needs that students need for quality education, a better solution must be made that allows students from all income levels and all necessities to come together and get the proper education that they need.

 ## Solution
 
 This web app provides an interactive state map for a quick intuitive path of resources, a rental system for educators to access technology for student educational purposes, and filter systems within the rental platform. These features are to aid low-income students in acquiring the necessary digital resources for a high-quality education through the support of their Washington State  K-12 educators.

  ### Site Layout

### Features

**1) Washington State Map (Home Page):**
Our landing page will feature an interactive map of the state of washington. The user will be able to hover over their respective county within the state, allowing them to click and be redirected to that county's resources. This provides a quick, intuitive path for educators to quickly access the information they need for their respective location. 

**2)Filter Systems:**
_(Allowing user to search type of resource they need (ex: wifi) and shows availability)_ 
We will also have a filter system feature that would allow users to search for a type of resource that they need, like WiFi. It will also show whether or not that resource is available. The user will be given the list of items that they asked for, and they will be provided with information on how long they can have the resource for. Another piece of information provided is the type of technology so that users will know for sure that what they are searching for is what they are looking for. And lastly, the filter system will include a distance measure so that the user will know how far away they have to go to collect the resource.

**3)Rental systems**

- Equipment list
- Reserve equipment

Another one of our features will be the student technology rental system. This rental system will run through the school so only students will be able to check out technology products. This feature will incorporate an equipment list that allows them to reserve equipment based on their need. We will also include an overview section that explains the process to the students so that they know what is expected of them during their time using the equipment. Applying this feature as a part of our website will allow families with low-income to have a solution for accessing technology for educational purposes.
