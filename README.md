 ## Problem Statement

The pandemic has impacted students in low-income families from switching to an online environment creating a greater divide in the quality of education provided for students. How might we aid educators in providing proper resources for low-income students so that they can achieve a higher-quality education?
According to New America, internet access at home is required for students to receive a quality education. However, approximately 16.9 million children do not have access to high-speed internet at home (Farry, 2021). A vast majority of the children in this statistic are low-income people of color, with African American and Hispanic households being 1.3 to 1.4 times as likely as white households to lack digital accessibility (McDonald, 2020).  This problem persists in early education and it is critical to aid these students before they fall too far behind. Specifically, children in marginalized communities have a higher chance of falling through the cracks of education, preventing them from obtaining many opportunities in their future. The UN states that as classrooms shift to relying on technology for learning and homework, low-income students are less equipped to participate and are at a high risk of dropping out of school (UN, 2021). In this pursuit, it is essential for us to involve support for and from the educators. An article published by Mckinsey and Company suggests how low-income families are not able to properly afford certain online learning devices and that many school systems fail to understand how online learning is not a reasonable possibility for them. This was only exemplified when COVID-19 hit. This caused disparities in school completion in impoverished communities. Additional causes such as lack of funds, conditions, and large student-to-teacher ratios have all contributed to inadequate education for low-income students.  
Current solutions have not shown improvements on low-income students' mental health and learning experiences. With many existing solutions not being able to fulfill the needs that students need for quality education, a better solution must be made that allows students from all income levels and all necessities to come together and get the proper education that they need.
